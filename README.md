# Exosky_By-_Nova_Six
An Exosky is a web app which will help in understanding of  the viewer  about the constellation position changing from exoplanet's sky perspective  . First they can view the constellation's stars position visible on Earth's sky  and then they can draw the constellation by the joining those stars point and can see a new phase of that constellation.

# Overview:
EXOSKY is a web-app that focuses on exploring and understandingexoplanets—planets that orbit stars beyond our solar system. Ourmission is to bring the wonders of space to people of all agesbycreating an immersive, interactive platformthat showcases distantworlds and their night sky.

Through innovative 2D models, educational content, EXOSKYaimstoinspire curiosity and ignite a passion for astronomy andspacescience.We are dedicated to engaging the next generation of astronomersandspace enthusiasts by making the exploration of exoplanets accessible,exciting, and interactive.
